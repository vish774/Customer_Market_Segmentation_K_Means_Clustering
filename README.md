# Customer_Market_Segmentation_K_Means_Clustering

Project Name:-  Mall_Customers_Segmentation_using_K-Means_Clustering

Problem Statement:

You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards , you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

Problem Statement You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge [Target Customers] so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.

Project Name:-  Market_Segmentation_using_K-Means_Clustering

Problem Statement

In this project we are trying to perform customer market segmentation.
So you have been hired as a DS to a bank in New York City.
The bank has extensive data about their customers.

For the past six months the marketing team at the bank wanted to launch a targeted ad marketing campaign by dividing the customers into at least three different groups/clusters(so we're going to talk a lot about the clusters in this project infact we're going to use k means clustering algorithm in this project).
So basically the marketing team based on the customers mindset will be able to launch a targeted marketing campaign.

They want to learn and understand about their customers.
They want to know the spending habits of the customers.
So that's basically the objective of this project.

 what we're going to see in this project:
 
perform exploratory data analysis and visualize customers data set using distplot, histograms and KDE

learn how to fill out missing data points or null elements for short.

Understand this theory and intuition behind K Means clustering algorithm.

Learn how to find the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

Apply k means algorithm and sklearn to perform market segmentation

Understand the intuition behind principle component analysis with PCA for short.

Apply PCA to perform dimensionality reduction using real world data set
